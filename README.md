# 👋 Hello, I'm Ranzy

I architect and engineer scalable, resilient, and highly optimized enterprise cloud solutions. My focus lies in building fault-tolerant distributed systems, integrating AI/ML pipelines, and driving automation across cloud-native platforms.

## 🔧 Areas of Expertise
- **Distributed Systems:** Architecting resilient, event-driven microservices with strong consistency and failover strategies.
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Automating scalable deployments using GitOps, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, and AWS.
- **Observability:** Implementing end-to-end telemetry using OpenTelemetry, distributed tracing, and proactive alerting.
- **AI/ML Integration:** Operationalizing machine learning with real-time analytics, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection at scale.

## 🚀 Currently Advancing
- **AI/ML Deployment at Scale:** Enhancing end-to-end ML workflows — from feature engineering and model optimization to scalable inference — with an emphasis on performance, reproducibility, and MLOps best practices.

## 🤝 Let's Collaborate
I'm open to strategic engineering initiatives involving:
- Scaling cloud-native platforms (Kubernetes, AWS, Linux) with performance, reliability, and security in mind.
- Embedding AI into microservices to drive intelligent automation and continuous optimization.
- Evolving DevOps culture through platform engineering and cutting-edge observability practices.
