# 👋 Hello, I'm Ranzy

I architect and engineer highly scalable, fault-tolerant cloud-native systems with deep observability and intelligent automation. My work enables performance at scale across distributed architectures, real-time AI/ML pipelines, and DevOps culture evolution.

## 🔧 Areas of Expertise

- **Distributed Systems** — Event-driven, resilient, and highly available service architectures.
- **Cloud Infrastructure** — Scalable, reproducible deployments via IaC, GitOps, and orchestration.
- **Observability** — System-wide insights using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- **AI/ML Integration** — TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas — deploying and scaling models in production.
